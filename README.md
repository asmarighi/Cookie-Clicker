<h2>Step 1: base structure</h2>

Write the base structure for the project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Within the HTML, put a click button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at 0 to display said counter.

<h2>Step 2: prepare the JavaScript</h2>

In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.

<h2>Step 3: increase the score</h2>

When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by 1, then display the current score inside the label.

<h2>Step 4: make a multiplier</h2>

Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by two for example.

<h2>Step 5: price of multiplier</h2>

The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

<h2>Step 6: no credit</h2>

You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

<h2>Step 7: display multiplier counter</h2>

Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like multiplier x5.

<h2>Step 8: increase the cost</h2>

Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

<h2>Step 9: display the cost</h2>

In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.

<h2>Step 10: auto-clicker</h2>

Implement a new improvement to buy, the auto-click. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each x seconds.

<h2>Step 11: bonus</h2>

Implement yet another improvement to buy, the bonus. It should grant the player a boost in score of 200% per click for 30 seconds. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.

<h2>Step 12: deactivate the buttons</h2>

Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.

<h2>Step 13: make it pretty</h2>

Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.
